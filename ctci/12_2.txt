Probably a graph database is the best fitting tool, but I don't know much about graph databases.

In sql you could have two tables:

Users
- ID

Friends
- user1_id
- user2_id
- accepted

When a friend request is created, it creates a user1_id -> user2_id entry in the join table. The accepted field is set to true when the friend request is accepted.

Querying a path between two users is a pretty expensive read operation. One way to do this would be to write a recursive SQL script, but even that is probably too expensive for large request load.

Ultimately that type of request probably needs to be pre-calculated and cached.
