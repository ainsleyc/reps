OSPF:

- Routing protol used for IP
- Each router forms IP datagrams that contain information about it's known topology to neighboring routers
- Together, the routers build a topology of the network which is exposed as the IP routing table
- IP can then just use the target addresa and the routing table to determine the next hop to route packets to.
