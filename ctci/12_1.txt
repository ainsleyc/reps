Submit endpoint
POST /<company_id>/end_of_day_price
{
  open:
  high:
  low:
  closing:
}

Get single company endpoint:
GET /<company_id>?date=<date>

Get all companies endpoint:
GET /all/?date=<date>

Notes:
* All can be stored in a simple SQL database, or nosql like Mongo since the data is pretty non-relational
* For high volume reads, both the get endpoints can be easily cached since the data is static
* We can add additional write logic, like only allowing a single submit of end-of-day price per company.
* Post endpoints should require authentication to prevent shenanigans
