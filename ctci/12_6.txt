To detect duplicate documents, use a hashing function with a large enough number of bits and hash the entire contents of each page, inserting into a hash table as the key as you do so.

If you ever encounter a hash key that already has been found, you have found a duplicate page.

For a large number of urls the cache should probably be external, using something like redis or memcached.
