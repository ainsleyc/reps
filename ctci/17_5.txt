TCP and UDP are both transaction layer protocols on top of IP.

UDP does not provide any assurances, just sends the packet to specified IP and port without any handshake / confirmation.

TCP does multiple things to ensure the data arrives correctly:
- First a 3-way handshake is established using SYN / SYN-ACK / ACK packets
- A sequence number is used to reconstruct the incoming data in order, even if the network causes them to arrive out of order
- The reciever sends a cumulative acknowledgement, indicating the last byte is received and what it expects to recieve next
- If sender detects after some time that packets have been lost, it will retransmit the indicated packet the reciever is expecting.
- Reciever also specifies the size of it's recieve window, or how much data is is willing to buffer. Sender only allows that much data to be in-flight at once
- Congestion control: slow-start, congestion-avoidance, fast retransmit
