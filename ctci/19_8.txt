Easiest way is to just index all the words in the book by count beforehand, for constant time access to the word count in the book.
You can also index whatever data you need, such as the mage numbers of the words, etc.

If you have to do it at runtime for some reason, it will take linear time to do so. Hoever you can then cache the word count results
so that all future requests will be constant time.
