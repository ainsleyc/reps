Start with 2 data structures: visited hash and results max heap.

For each point going from x to y,
  if the current point is not in the visited array,
    recursively attempt to expand the matrix in 8 directions:
      left
      right
      up
      down
      up-left
      up-right
      down-left
      down-right
    do this until the entire matrix has been examined, and record the largest matrix that was found in the maxheap
    also record all nodes used in the max matrix in the visited hash
