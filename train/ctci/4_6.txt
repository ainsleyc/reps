Tree First Common Ancestor

- For each node, create an array of node references
  - Follow the parent pointers back to the root node, pushing a pointer
    to each node into the array
- Once each node has an array of ancestor nodes, start at the last node
  of each array (which is the tree's root node)
  - Take one step at a time through each node's array, and compare the
    references.
  - Once a different node is encountered, the previous node is the 
    first common ancestor.

- O(n) where n is the average depth of the tree.
