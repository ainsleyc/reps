Denormalization is the process of reducing the duplication of data by extracting it from a table and making it into a seperate table.

For example, if a users table has a "state" column, you can denormalize it by createing a state table and replacing the "state" column with a "state_id" column referencing the state table.

The advantage of denormalization is increasing the consistency of the database. If you ever need to change the name of a state, you only need to change it in one place instead of many, removing the change of error. Also you can use foreign keys to enforce integrity, for example nto allowing a state that is not in the state table.

The disadvantage it slower queries due to large number of joins. 

The extreme of denormalization is modern nosql databases like mongo, which claim to give you speed in exchange of denormalizing your database.
