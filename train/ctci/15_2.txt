Inner join: most common, returns all rows from where there is a matched key in the left and right table.

SELECT user.id, user.name, department.name from user
INNER JOIN department 
ON user.department_id = department.id

Left/right join: Like the inner join, but also return values from the left/right table that didn't find any matches in the left/right table. One use case is when there is optional information on a table: in example above, if some users don't have a department_id.

Outer join: Also return all values from left and right table that don't have matching keys.
