OOCSS
* Seperate styling of text/lists/etc and apply everywhere for consistent styling
* Seperate structure (widths, layout) from skin (styling)
* Use classes for styling, so that they will be reusable
* Use parent / child classes
* Make parent / child elements independent, parent should not require child for correct styling
* For reusable classes don't use fixed heights and widths for reusability
* Extend existing class styles by using an additional .class
* Look for places to abstract away classes of styling so that they can be reused

BEM
* Block: Standalone, meaningful entity
* Element: Part of block, no standalone meaning
* Modifiers: Flags on blocks or elements
* Use "--" syntax to extend existing style classes
