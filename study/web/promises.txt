Problem:

* Callbacks create an inversion of control problem
* You cannot be sure that the callback will be called correctly, and only once

Solution:

* With promises you still pass callbacks, but where you pass callbacks is shifted
* Promises will only return a single success or failure
* Completed promises are immutable
* Any object that implements the then() function can be wrapped into a 
  normalized promise

Limitations:

* Errors in the final success in a promise chain is not included in the chained
  error handling
* Promises cannot return multiple values (returning multi-valued object is a bit
  of a hack)
* Must create a new promise each time a chain of events occurs, inefficent for 
  reactive events like mouse clicks
