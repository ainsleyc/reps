Problem:

* Callbacks create an inversion of control problem
* You cannot be sure that the callback will be called correctly, and only once

Solution:

* With promises you still pass callbacks, but where you pass callbacks is shifted
* Promises will only return a single success or failure
* Completed promises are immutable
* Any object that implements the then() function can be wrapped into a 
  normalized promise
