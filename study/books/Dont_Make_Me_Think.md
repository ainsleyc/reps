* Don't make me think
  * Don't use obscure / technical names
  * Things should be obviously clickable
  * Search should not require sub-filtering / pulldowns

* How we really use the web
  * We scan pages, not read them
  * We don't choose the best option, we choose the first reasonable option
  * We don't figure out how things work, we muddle through

* Billboard design 101
  * Create a clear visual heiarchy
    * The more important something is, the more prominent it is
    * Things that are related logically are also related visually
    * Things are nested visually to show whats part of what
  * Conventions are your friend
  * Break up pages into clearly defined areas
  * Make it obvious what is clickable
  * Remove unneeded noise from the page

* Mindless choices
  * Number of clicks matter less than how much thought each click takes
  * Should provide queues that give users continued confidence that they are on the right track

* Omit needless words
  * Remove happy talk
  * Things should be self explanitory, remove instructions  
  
Street Signs and Breadcrumbs
* Web navigation 101
  * You are usually trying to find something
  * You decide whether to ask first of browse first
  * Browsers willuse the sites search hiearchy to find their way around
  * If you can't find what you are lookign for, you will leave
* Difficulties of browsing
  * No sense of scale
  * No sense of direction
  * No sense of location
  * Home pages are important because they are fixed
  * Back button comprises 30~40% of web clicks
  * Figuring out where you are is a more pervasive problem in the web
* Overlooked purposes of navigation
  * It gives us something to anchor us while navigating
  * It tells us what's here
  * It tells us how to use the site
  * It gives us confidence in the people that built it
* Web navigation conventions
  * Persistent Navigation
    * Sections
      * Links to top level hiearchy of the site
      * Often will also include second-level sub-menus
    * Site ID
      * Typically upper left hand corner
      * Distinctive typeface and graphic
    * Utilities
      * Shopping cart, help, etc
      * Things that don't fit into the site hiearchy
      * Should be smaller than the hiearchy
    * A way home
      * Commonly also the site ID
    * Search
      * A simple, search-everythign box is best
      * Be careful of adding too many search options that confuse the user
    * Occational Exceptions
      * Homepage
      * Forms
  * Give proper attention to the tertiary and lower navigation hiearchies
  * Page names
    * Each page needs to have a prominent name
    * The name should match what the user clicked to get there
    * The name should frame the content that is unique to the page
  * There should always be an indicator of where you are in the page hiearchy
    * They should not be so subtle as to lose their value
  * Breadcrumbs
    * Should only be used as secondary navigation
    * Use small type
    * Boldface the last item
  * Tabs are good
    * They are self-evident
    * They are hard to miss
    * They can be visually interesting
  * Try trunk test
* Designing the Homepage
  * Needs to include
    * Site identity and mission
    * Site heiarchy
    * Search
    * Teases
    * Timely content
    * Deals
    * Shortcuts
    * Registration
  * Conveying the big picture
    * What is this?
    * What can I do here?
    * What do they so here?
    * Why should I be here and not somewhere else?
  * How to get the message across
    * tagline
    * the welcome blurb
    * use as much space as necessary
    * ... but don't use any more space than necessary
    * Don't use a mission statement as a welcome blurb
    * It's one of the mose important things to test
  * The trouble with pulldowns
    * You have to seek them out
    * They are had to scan
    * They are twitchy
    * Best for lists of known values, like countries
* Design Debates
  * Designers/developers/business folks have different priorities for web design
  * The average user is a myth: don't try to figure out what the "average" user wants
  * You need to watch users using your site
* Usability Testing
  * Focus groups are not usability tests
  * After a few weeks the devs dont have fresh eyes. You need outside testers
  * Even testing one user is much better than nothing
  * Testing one user early is much better than testing many later
  * Recruiting representative users is overrated
  * Trying to use test between different UI is generally too costly
  * Test iteratively, 3~4 people per round is enough
  * Trying testing a similar site if available first
  * Review the results right away and decide a course of action
  * Typical Problems
    * Users are unclear on the concept
    * The words they are looking for aren't there
    * There's too much going on
  * Triage guidelines
    * Ignore problems that where all testers are able to right themselves quickly
    * Resist the temptation to add things like explanations
    * Take new feature requests with a grain of salt
    * Grab the low hanging fruit
    * Be careful with changes, consider what other parts of the site will be affected
  * One morning a month is enough usability testing
* User Goodwill
  * Losing goodwill
    * Hiding information user wants (ex. contact information)
    * Punishing users for not doing it your way
    * Asking for information you don't need
    * Shocking and jiving the user
    * Putting sizzle in the way of usability
    * Having a site that looks amaturish
