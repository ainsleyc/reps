  * We don't figure out how things work, we muddle through

* Billboard design 101
  * Create a clear visual heiarchy
    * The more important something is, the more prominent it is
    * Things that are related logically are also related visually
    * Things are nested visually to show whats part of what
  * Conventions are your friend
  * Break up pages into clearly defined areas
  * Make it obvious what is clickable
  * Remove unneeded noise from the page

* Mindless choices
  * Number of clicks matter less than how much thought each click takes
  * Should provide queues that give users continued confidence that they are on the right track

* Omit needless words
  * Remove happy talk
  * Things should be self explanitory, remove instructions
