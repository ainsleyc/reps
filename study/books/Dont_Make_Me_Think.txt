* Don't make me think
  * Don't use obscure / technical names
  * Things should be obviously clickable
  * Search should not require sub-filtering / pulldowns

* How we really use the web
  * We scan pages, not read them
  * We don't choose the best option, we choose the first reasonable option
  * We don't figure out how things work, we muddle through

* Billboard design 101
  * Create a clear visual heiarchy
    * The more important something is, the more prominent it is
    * Things that are related logically are also related visually
    * Things are nested visually to show whats part of what
  * Conventions are your friend
  * Break up pages into clearly defined areas
  * Make it obvious what is clickable
  * Remove unneeded noise from the page

* Mindless choices
  * Number of clicks matter less than how much thought each click takes
  * Should provide queues that give users continued confidence that they are on the right track
